# Hunter-game

Created on Unity as a learning project to show the possibilities of steering behaviours.

You are playing as Hunter (blue icon), you can shoot different targets (try hard to hit them, when you get close enough, but be ready you are low on ammo).
Other entities in the scene: rabbits (white), deers (brown) and wolf (red, so you can't miss it. It tries to hunt everything down and eat).
